# Genres-Analysis---EDA-Clustring

## TMDB data set

* Kaggle data set The movies data base contain over 10,000 movies contain sevral information about New columns:

    homepage
    id

    overview
    popularity
    production_companies

* The secound task is to create a movie recommendation system based on the movies generes using sklearn Kmean algorithm <br>
  `from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`

## Contribution

You are most wellcome to fork my notebook and update my code , below some inspiration points could be worked on :
* Can you categorize the films by type, such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this, but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.
* How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?

## Original notebook

The original notebook was build on kaggel karnel please visit my notebook [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/hassanshahin/genres-analysis-eda-clustring/data) and upvote if you found some thing useful.
